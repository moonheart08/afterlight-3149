Afterlight: 3149 is a fork of [Space Station 14](https://spacestation14.io/), with a focus on space flight, asteroid mining, and exploration instead of Space Station 14's round-to-round destructive chaos.

Afterlight: 3149 is still early in development; please wait if you wish to see more content, or better, help code the game yourself.
Like the main game, all code added to Afterlight: 3149 is under the same license as the main Space Station 14 repo.
All audio and image assets unique to Afterlight: 3149 are ideally to be licensed under CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0, if possible.

Afterlight: 3149 is a drop-in replacement for Space Station 14 when hosting, requiring no extra effort on the player's part to join. RobustToolbox, Space Station 14's game engine, permits modifying everything contained within the Content packages. You are encouraged to fork and modify Space Station 14 (and by extension Afterlight: 3149) to suit your goals.
