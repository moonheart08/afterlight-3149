A small fragment of a maintenance hideout what was probably a decently large ship.
Powered with ion thrusters and a plasma generator, the bare minimum to even survive on the Rim.

Remarks: It's a miracle this even flies, you should probably know at least the basics of construction if you want to live.
Roster: 3 Salvage Specialists
