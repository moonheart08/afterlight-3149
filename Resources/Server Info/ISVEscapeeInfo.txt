A small escape pod mainly used by prisoners to escape serving time in jail.
Retrofitted with uranium generators, gas-driven thrusters, and cryogenic storage,
making it technically capable as a living space. Does not include ore processing equipment.

Remarks: DO NOT pick this if there are no other players! With no ore processor means
no powering the generators, YOU WILL BE STRANDED.
Roster: 3 Passengers
