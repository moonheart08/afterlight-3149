An upper class ship with a mix of science and salvage equipment
While not fully geared towards science itâ€™s one of the only ships
available at the Rim that has a proper research room.

Remarks: A ship that is not too cramped nor too wide. Contains
a cargo bay to prevent hallways overflowing with crates.
Roster: 2 Salvage Specialists, 3 Scientists
