A large, biofuel-powered ship.
Best with a mid-size crew, definitely do not try and tackle this one alone.
When it's actually staffed, provides a fairly calm experience but limited access to advanced R&D. 

Remarks: Great for more in-depth, relaxed roleplay.
Roster: 1 Salvage Specialist, 1 Chef, 1 Bartender, 1 Botanist, 2 Passengers
